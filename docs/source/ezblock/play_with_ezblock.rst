Play with Ezblock
===========================

**Ezblock** is a development platform developed by SunFounder designed for beginners to lower the barriers to getting started with Raspberry Pi. 
It has two programming languages: Graphical and Python, and available on almost all different types of devices.
With Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support, you can download code, remote control a Raspberry Pi, on Ezblock Studio.

Ezblock has been upgraded to the third version.

Compared with the Bluetooth communication of Ezblock 2, Ezblock 3 uses Websocket to communicate, which is much faster.

To make it faster and easier to use, we have optimized the connection and usage process so that you can learn programming quickly with Ezblock Studio.

So the rest of the content is done with Ezblock 3.
