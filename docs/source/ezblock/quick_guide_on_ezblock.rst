Quick Guide on Ezblock
===========================

We've put all the detailed tutorials for Ezblock 3 in `Ezblock Studio 3 <https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/ezblock3/en/latest/#>`_.

Before Assembling
--------------------

But before assembling, you only need to complete `Download and Install Ezblock OS <https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/ezblock3/en/latest/quick_user_guide_for_ezblock3.html#download-and-install-ezblock-os>`_.

After burning the Ezblock system, P11 was set to calibrate the servo angle to 0°. To make sure you can see that the servo has been set to 0°, you can insert a rocker arm in the servo shaft first and then turn the servo to another angle.

Now follow the diagram below and insert the servo to the P11 position.

So now if the servo arm returns after the servo arm returns, this function will take effect. If not, press the **RESET button** to restart.

.. note::
    Before assembling each servo, you need to plug the servo pin into P11 and keep the power on.

    This function will be invalid after writing any programs.



Before Programming
------------------------


Before you program, you need to download Ezblock Studio. The current download is Ezblock 2, and you will need to manually upgrade to Ezblock 3.
