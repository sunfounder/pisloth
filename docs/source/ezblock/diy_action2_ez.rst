===============

Through the last lesson, I learned how to customize the movement of Pisloth. In this lesson, we will directly control the Pisloth's four-servo through the control-widget, so that you can have a more intuitive understanding of the Pisloth's operating machine. Help you customize some more interesting actions.

**TIPS**

Variables can be created on this page. We create four variables to represent the rotation angles of the four servos.

Set the value of the servo rotation plus 1 or minus 1 each time you press the key.
